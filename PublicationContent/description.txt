[h1]Description[/h1]
Yet another scoreboard...
Based on the scoreboard from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1963099942]ClassicHUD[/url] and heavily modified.

[h1]Whitelisted?[/h1]
[b]No.[/b] But I really hope that it will be whitelisted.

[b]‚ö†Ô∏è I submitted whitelist request here:[/b]
https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/whitelisting-mods-and-mutators.120340/page-3#post-2353668

[h1]Usage (single player)[/h1]
[olist]
[*]Subscribe to this mutator;
[*]Start KF2;
[*]Open console (`) and input:
[b]open KF-BioticsLab?Mutator=YAS.YASMut?[/b]
(replace the map and add the parameters you need)
[*]<Enter>.
[/olist]

[h1]Usage (server)[/h1]
[b]Note:[/b] [i]If you don't understand what is written here, read the article [url=https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Dedicated_Server_(Killing_Floor_2)][u]Dedicated Server (KF2 wiki)[/u][/url] before following these instructions.[/i]
[olist]
[*]Open your [b]PCServer-KFEngine.ini[/b] / [b]LinuxServer-KFEngine.ini[/b];
[*]Find the [b][IpDrv.TcpNetDriver][/b] section and make sure that there is a line (add if not):
[b]DownloadManagers=OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.SteamWorkshopDownload[/b]
‚ùóÔ∏è If there are several [b]DownloadManagers=[/b] then the line above should be the first ‚ùóÔ∏è
[*]Add the following string to the [b][OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.KFWorkshopSteamworks][/b] section (create one if it doesn't exist):
[b]ServerSubscribedWorkshopItems=2521826524[/b]
[*]Start the server and wait until the mutator is downloading;
[*]Add mutator to server start parameters: [b]?Mutator=YAS.YASMut[/b] and restart the server.
[/olist]

[h1]Important setup information[/h1]
The config should be created on first start, but now the game contains a bug that initializes the config values ‚Äã‚Äãrandomly if they are not explicitly set. Thus, the config may have incorrect values ‚Äã‚Äãor not be created at all.
So if you are using this mutator for the first time, I highly recommend doing the following:
[olist]
[*]Create (modify) [b]KFYAS.ini[/b] manually. Put the following content there:
[b][YAS.YAS]
Version=0[/b]
[*]Start the game/server with YAS to generate the contents of the config.
[*]Close the game/server.
[/olist]
[b]Right now this is the only way to correctly create the default config.[/b]
Unfortunately I can't do anything about it because it's a game problem (not mutator). I hope TWI fixes this someday.

[h1]Setup (KFYAS.ini)[/h1]
[b][YAS.MessageOfTheDay][/b]
In this section you can customize the messages that will be shown at the bottom of the panel.
[list]
[*][b]bRandomize[/b] - If True the message will be chosen randomly;
[*][b]DisplayTime[/b] - message display time in seconds;
[*][b]Message[/b] - Array of messages to display. Place multiple 'Message=' below each other if you want to specify multiple messages. If you need a line break in a message, use '[b]\n[/b]'.
[/list]

[b][YAS.Ranks][/b]
here you can set display settings for different player ranks.

[b]Why?[/b] for example, to highlight admins... or players who have done a lot for the server - this does not change the gameplay in any way, but these people will be pleased. Or just for fun of course :3

Edit [b]Player[/b] and [b]Admin[/b] lines to set how this is displayed:
[list]
[*][b]RankName[/b] - rank name. Leave blank if you don't want this to be shown.
[*][b]RankColor[/b] - rank display color.
[*][b]PlayerColor[/b] - player name display color of the player with this rank.
[/list]

Use [b]Rank[/b] array to set your own ranks:
[list]
[*][b]RankName[/b] - same as above.
[*][b]RankColor[/b] - same as above.
[*][b]PlayerColor[/b] - same as above.
[*][b]RankID[/b] - used to establish a relation between a player and his rank (more on that below), you can use any value greater than zero.
[*][b]OverrideAdmin[/b] - If True then this rank will be displayed even if the player is an admin.
[/list]

[b][YAS.RankRelations][/b]
Use [b]Relation[/b] array to establish a relation between a player and their rank:
[list]
[*][b]RankID[/b] - RankID from the [b][YAS.Ranks][/b] section.
[*][b]ObjectID[/b] - ID for which this rank will be applied. This can be a player's SteamID64, a player's UniqueID, or a steam group's SteamID64 (then the rank will be applied to all members of that group).
[/list]

[b]Ranks priority[/b]
[list]
[*]Personal ranks are higher in priority than group ranks, so if a player belongs to both the group rank and the personal rank, then the personal rank will be used.
[*]The higher the position in [b][YAS.RankRelations][/b] the higher the rank priority. That is, if a player belongs to two group relations at once, the one that is higher in the list will be used.
[/list]

[b]Rank example[/b]
When your config is generated for the first time there will be an example rank - 'Man of Culture'. It has green color and relation with ObjectID 103582791429670253 (which is the SteamID64 of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/hentaii]this group[/url]). Thus, if you leave this setting, when someone from this group enters the game, he will have a green rank 'Man of Culture'.
You can use this as a template for creating your own ranks, or remove it if you don't need it.

[h1]Getting IDs[/h1]
You can view the Steam ID and UniqueID in WebAdmin on the PLAYERS tab:
[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenZmeY/KF2-YetAnotherScoreboard/master/PublicationContent/ID1.png[/img]

But don't try to use the SteamID from here for EGS players - it won't work. SteamID is for Steam players only.
UniqueID is suitable for all platforms.

SteamID can also be obtained from the player's profile, look at the URL:
[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenZmeY/KF2-YetAnotherScoreboard/master/PublicationContent/ID2.png[/img]

If a player uses a nickname in a link to their profile, then add this to the profile url: [b]?xml=1[/b]
[img]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenZmeY/KF2-YetAnotherScoreboard/master/PublicationContent/ID3.png[/img]

If you need a SteamID64 for a steam group, open the group in a browser and add this to the url: [b]/memberslistxml/?xml=1[/b]
