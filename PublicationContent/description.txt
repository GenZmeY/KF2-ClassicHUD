[h1]Description[/h1]
Yet another scoreboard...
Based on the scoreboard from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1963099942]ClassicHUD[/url] and heavily modified. 

[h1]Features[/h1]
- Doesn't block the view with the mouse when active;
- Correctly displayed in all available resolutions;
- Displays a large number of players;
- Customizing the appearance and elements of the scoreboard;
- Player ranks.

[h1]Whitelisted?[/h1]
No. This mod is not whitelisted and will unrank your server. Any XP gained will not be saved.

(But I plan to submit a whitelist request when I stop adding changes to this scoreboard)

[h1]Usage (single player):[/h1]
1. Subscribe to this mutator;
2. Start KF2; 
3. Open console (`) and input:
[code]open KF-BioticsLab?Mutator=YAS.YASMut?[/code]
4. <Enter>.

[h1]Usage (server):[/h1]

2. Add the following string to the [b][OnlineSubsystemSteamworks.KFWorkshopSteamworks][/b] section:

3. Start the server and wait while the mutator is downloading;
4. Stop the server;
5. Add mutator to server start line: [b]?Mutator=YAS.YASMut[/b]
7. Start the server.

[h1]Setup[/h1]
All settings are here:

I will add detailed instructions for setting up the scoreboard later.
But these images will help you a little anyway:

[h1]Bug reports[/h1]
If you find a bug, describe what it looks like and how to repeat it - I will try to fix it. 
You can do it right here, but I'll be much happier if you do it [url=https://github.com/GenZmeY/KF2-YetAnotherScoreboard/issues]in issues on github[/url].
